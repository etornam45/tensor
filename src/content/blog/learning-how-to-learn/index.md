Learning something new is hard, especially if you have no related knowledge about what you
want to learn. Acquiring new knowledge is challenging, particularly when you lack existing
knowledge in the subject area.


## Distinction Between Schooling and Education
Learning is not confined to the walls of a school, nor is education solely delivered in a
classroom. While schools provide structured learning, true education extends beyond them.
People learn through personal experiences, mentorship, trial and improvement, self-directed
study, and even casual conversations. Many of the world’s most successful individuals attribute
their knowledge to lifelong learning rather than formal education alone. Whether through
reading, hands-on practice, or digital resources, learning is a continuous process that goes
beyond grades and certificates.


Learning how to learn helps you as a student and as a person. Developing the ability to acquire
new knowledge and skills quickly and independently is crucial to solving personal life problems.
Economically, people with valuable knowledge or skills make more money than those with little.

> “Unlike the stomach, the brain doesn’t alert you when it’s empty.”
> — African Proverb. The only


way you become aware that you need more knowledge is through your environment.
Knowledgeable people can solve problems.
“People make history either by solving
problems or by creating them.
”


## People Who Succeed Without Formal Education

Formal education is one path to knowledge, but it is not the only one. Many successful
individuals such as Thomas Edison, who was largely self-taught, or modern self-made
entrepreneurs like Elon Musk achieved greatness through self-directed learning and
persistence. In the tech world, self-taught programmers have built billion-dollar companies, and
artists have gained mastery without formal training. While academic education can be valuable,
continuous learning, adaptability, and problem-solving skills often matter more than degrees.
There will always be stories of people who mark the walls of history or become successful
without academic education and the same is true for people with academic education. The
argument here is not implying one form of education is better than the other.


## The Role of Mistakes in Learning

The moral here is that our brains can learn. For most of us, our parents or friends did not teach
us how to use our favourite mobile app, but we did so by trying to use it and learning from the
mistakes and successes we made while trying to use the app. Same thing with toddlers,
toddlers get help from their parents at an early stage when trying to walk, and they fall many
times before actually making a first step. But once they don’t give up, the frequency of their fall
reduces over time. I’ll say learning is exponential, it’s hard to learn something you do not know
about.

Learning is built on mistakes. Babies don’t learn to walk by studying instructions: they try, fall,
and adjust until they succeed. Similarly, learning any new skill involves trial and error. Making
mistakes should not be seen as failure but as feedback. The key is to reflect on errors, adjust
strategies, and persist. Those who embrace failure as part of the learning process often
progress faster than those who fear making mistakes.

It's important to learn any form of intelligence. No one knows everything at birth but, there will be
children who can without todling. There will be baby engineers and baby astronauts. Anyone
can learn anything. This is something we can learn from babies.
Any baby with no physical disability can learn to walk for three things I’ve observed. Firstly, they
are very passionate about walking just like any other adult they see walking. Secondly, they are
very focused and disciplined. Thirdly, they don’t need any motivation, once a person is
passionate and focused then there’s no need for motivation at all. Motivation is for those who do
not have the passion to learn something and are in the phase of developing the passion for it.
Passion and motivation play different but interconnected roles in learning. Passion is a strong,
internal drive that makes learning feel effortless, while motivation whether intrinsic (personal
curiosity) or extrinsic (rewards, recognition) helps push through initial resistance. In many cases,
people start with external motivation before developing genuine passion. For instance, a student
learning to code might begin because of job opportunities but later become passionate about
problem-solving. Understanding where you stand in terms of passion and motivation can help
you structure your learning process more effectively.


Your goal before learning anything is to assess if you have the passion to do it and if you are
focused enough. Once you know your stand it’s easier to know what to do. Finding focus and
passion is hard at the beginning of learning anything. It’s hard to find focus if you don’t know
what to learn. The same applies to passion if you don't know why you are learning what you are
learning. Before learning anything, try to answer these two questions. 1 “Why am I learning
this?” and 2 “What do I gain from learning it?”
. The latter question even guides you to what
depth to learn.
An example is “Learning how to swim”
. The answer to the former question could be “to be the
best swimmer in my school or community” while the former could be “Fame, recognition and
awards”


To fully learn anything means you can create. Creating does not necessarily mean creating
something physical but also having the ability to create new knowledge. To achieve this requires
moving gradually from stage to stage.
Finding passion through curiosity
Passion often begins with curiosity. A simple question such as why salt dissolves in water can
spark an interest in chemistry or physics. Curiosity typically starts small and grows as we
explore new ideas. It’s not an innate skill but a habit that can be developed by asking questions,
experimenting, and seeking answers.


One can only teach oneself through curiosity. It usually starts with a small idea, a conversational
argument, or a piece of text. A dot of insight can quickly evolve depending on the amount of
time, passion and focus you allocate to any form of insight.
I love drawing now, I do art unconsciously. I got the insight that I could draw through a Primary
1(Grade 1) assignment. The assignment was simple “Draw and label the parts of a human
body”. It was easy to cheat on the assignment by tracing the outline of the human body from the
textbook I had. The insight was simple: Can I draw the assignment without tracing an original
work? The answer was quite simple. Yes, I could draw my assignment without tracing.
Ambition won’t find you. You have to find one by exploring so many things. Once you find one,
you’ve got passion. All that’s left is discipline and focus. The best way to focus is to remove any
destruction that prevents you from focusing on what’s more valuable to you. It’s usually gradual
but once you’ve developed these two habits, you won’t need any productivity hack to learn, you’ll
do it unconsciously.


If you often have to fallback on an alarm or a timetable to be consistent while learning
something, then you probably don’t have enough passion or focus to actually explore that topic
or knowledge. You can be in a flow state of learning without much struggle.
At anypoint in our life we are at the maximum point of knowledge or intelligence. You can only
fallback to realise how less knowledgeable you were a few years ago. At anypoint in our life we
learn new things but there are much more interesting and harder things (knowledge) to come by
naturally.
